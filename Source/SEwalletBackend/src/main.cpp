/*
 *****************************************************************************
 * APPLICATION PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION
 *****************************************************************************
 * GUI REQUESTS
 *
 * GUI sends requests in TLV format.
 * T -> 1 byte, uint8_t value from 0 to 255 to identify each  specific request
 * L -> 4 bytes, uint32_t value to tell how many bytes is V field
 * V -> L bytes, uint8_t* to be casted to stringstream  and deserialized  with
 *      Cereal library depending on T value
 *
 *****************************************************************************
 * SERVER RESPONSES
 *
 * The server or Backend (this program) sends  responses  to  the   GUI  using
 * the same TLV approach.
 * T -> 1 byte (uint8_t), it is the same value that the GUI sent
 * L -> 4 bytes (uint32_t), it is the dimension of the V field
 * V -> L bytes (uint8_t*), to be casted to stringstream and deserialized with
 *      Cereal library
 *
 *****************************************************************************
 * WARNING!
 *
 * T = 0 is reserved for  requests  and  responses  that  contain  exclusively
 * "string-like" data, so Cereal is not really required in this case (i.e. the
 * GUI sends "quit" to the server).
 * If T == 0, the GUI must not use Cereal... it  simply  needs  to process the
 * response in terms of the text that the server has sent (text-only responses
 * are used to signal  errors, i.e.  the  server could  not  read the  request
 * coming from the GUI).
 *
